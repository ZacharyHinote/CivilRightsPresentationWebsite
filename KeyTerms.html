  <p>Freedom Riders-On May 4, 1961, 13 African-American and white civil rights activists began the Freedom Rides. The freedom rides were a series of bus trips through the American South to protest segregation in interstate bus terminals. The freedom riders departed from Washington, D.C., and tried to integrate facilities at bus terminals into the South. 
“African-American Freedom Riders tried to use “whites-only” restrooms and lunch counters, and vice versa.”
“Over the next few months, several hundred Freedom Riders engaged in similar actions. “
